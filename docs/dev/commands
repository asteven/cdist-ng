## external commands ###

### explore ###
- run explorers and write their values to stdout

#### usage ####
cdist explore
- run all global explorers on localhost and print the name and value to stdout
   e.g.
hostname: foobar
os: archlinux
cpu_cores: 2

cdist explore target.example.com
- same thing but for remote target

cdist explorer --explorer hostname --explorer os target.example.com
cdist explorer --explorer hostname,os,os_version target.example.com
- run only the given explorers instead of all of them


### config ###
- configure one or more targets

### install ###
- install one or more targets

### deploy ###
- deploy an application to a target
- think capistrano or fabric

### help ###
- show help for cdist types, maybe others

### man ###
- show man pages of cdist types, maybe others

### patch ###
- just patch what has changed since last config run
- not sure if/how to do this, but it could give a massive speed up
- currently just random ideas ...
   - assume the target has not been changed manually since the last config run
   - maybe doable by just diffing object parameters against those of the last
     config run. But from where/how to get explorer values without running them?
      - maybe would need to re-run explorers at the end of `config` to capture the
        'after' state and feed that into `patch` as what would otherwise be
        returned by running the explorers.
   - maybe need to check which types have changed since the last config run so
      only those can be re-run
     - would need to record current state (git?, checksum?, ?) of a type to
       later on have a way to figure out which ones have changed


## internal commands ##
Only available from within cdist types.
Additional to external commands.


### log ###
- log a message with a given level, e.g.
   cdist log debug rest of args is message
   cdist log info currently doing this and that

### in-order ###
Nicer way to do what is currently done by the freaking ugly
   export CDIST_ORDER_DEPENDENCY=on

e.g.
cdist in-order start
__type_a
...
_type_b
cdist in-order stop
