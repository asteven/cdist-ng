### local file locations ###
# @see http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html
config files in ~/.config/cdist/
cache in ~/.cache/cdist/

: ${XDG_DATA_HOME:=$HOME/.local/share}
: ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:=$HOME/.config}
: ${XDG_CACHE_HOME:=$HOME/.cache}

### remote file locations for `cdist config` ###
/etc/cdist
/var/cache/cdist
/var/lib/cdist

### remote file locations for `cdist deploy` ###
Same as local file locations but on the target host


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

session: represent a single cdist invocation
   - shared among all targets

target: the information related to a single target
   - one for each target

context: the target context groups all relevant information to work on a target
   - the session instance
   - the target instance
   - file system paths to:
      - the target instance
      - local cache dir
      - remote cache dir


runtime: the cdist runtime implements the core functionality for interacting with the targets
   - one for each context

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


== old notes ==
- master process creates a session
- then forks a worker for each target
- each worker uses multiple asyncio coroutines to get the job done
- stdout and stderr of each subprocess are saved to disk
- logs are streamed to stdout or stderr
